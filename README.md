This app was cloned from a Heroku starter.

The algorithm was translated from the Fortran-77 Jacobi diagonalization routine from the classic "Numerical Recipes" book.

To do:

- handle errors in urls

- enable variables for use as values of attributes in template

- make tables prettier (padding, etc)

- put links to portfolio and repo on both pages

- flesh out background/instructions page, including links to other webpages that can do this calculation

- make code more Java-ish, including the replacement of generic loops w/array methods
